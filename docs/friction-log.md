# Friction Log: #

### 27/10 - 12:00: ###

 - Learning about databases, practicing using them with python ( basic CRUD functions)
 - Decided on using Supabase for database as I am familiar with other projects.
 - Need to figure out how to display table results on a HTML page (instead of terminal in VScode)
 - Going to leave “Auth” and “policies” to another day. I want to start displaying data on a screen.


### 1:00 ###

 - How do you show simple python outputs on the front end!? I have actually been at this for way too long. I just want to start off with something simple (“Hello World”) where I show the print(“Hello World”) on my python server to an index.html webpage. There seems to be a million ways to do it online like flask, pyscript, etc but I cant find the traditional way that its done.

### 04/11 - 19:10 ###

  - Been a while since I’ve had time to work on total recall but we need to start building. Figured out I need to be using flask on my server side.

  - The plan for the next two hours is to learn and try and get my server and flask set up for development. 

### 21:00 ###

 - Flask env set up ready for development
 - Set up github repo
 - Took longer than I was hoping (never did this properly before)
 - Tomorrow I need to practice with Flask’s “@route” and parameters as well as calling functions for data retrieval from database (which I’m just realising i need to add the supabase client auth to my codebase)

### 5/11 ##
 
  - Finished building out what I want total recall to look like on excalidraw (love that tool by the way). I'm happy whith how the UI for the [form](<img/Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 19.35.58.png>) came out where the user will input their notes, aswell as the UI for where the user will see their notes/questions to look over for that [day](<img/Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 19.32.19.png>).

  - Also created a [mobile version](<img/Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 19.35.58.png>) for this more to give me a feel as to how it could look aswell as keeping in a similar style to the desktop version (won't be building the mobile version out for TECS but good to have for the future).

### 7/11 ##

 - Forgot to mention what I have done over the last few days (hasn't been a whole lot - exam season). I have been learning about Flask's routes, parameters and arguments as that is how I'm going to be moving my data. Also learning about "GET", "POST" etc.
 - Learning is slow - my first time trying to figure any of this out without the help of AI. Hopefully progress speeds up more this weekend into next week as I start developing total recall properly.
