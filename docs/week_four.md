## summary Of Week Four

 - This week was crunch time. I had to get the final pieces of LLM functionality working and get to styling. School was very busy this week so I didn't have all that much time to work on it but I was able to get everything I wanted finished. The styling took much longer than anticipated however as I had to learn the basics of Tailwind, divs in divs etc.  

 - I had to create some variations on the original designes of the form and note display page. All images of which can be seen [here](img.md). All in all, I stuck quite closley to what I had designed in excalidraw and I'm happy with how it turned out.

 - This is my last update but I'm not finished with Total Recall, not only will I be using it on a daily basis, I will continnue to develop on top of it testing new coding concepts and a way of continuing to learn and improve.
