# Summary of week one #

 - I had to balence working on this project with school for the week as exam season is around the corner. However, while not much work was don code wise I have spent considerable hours learning Flask, databases and Web programming in general, something completely new to me. 

 - I also spent a few hours working out how I want total recall and the different pages to look, getting a feel for the UI and UX to go off of when developing. You can see the screenshots of which [here](/docs/img.md).

 - Hopefully I have the majority of the learning out of the way and I can get to developing the mvp of total recall.

 - You can see more detailed progress and my learnings in my [friction log](/docs/friction-log.md).

*Note*  - Any code you see in the database was purely for practice with Flask routes, parameters and arguments. It isn't supposed to be the buildings of total recall. This code is going to change a lot over next week.
