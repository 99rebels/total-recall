# Total Recall
## My TECS project to optimize learning.

## Weekly Notes ##
- [week 1 progress update](docs/week-one.md)


- [week 2 progress update](docs/week_two.md) 

- [week 3 progress update](docs/week_three.md)

- [Friction log](/docs/friction-log.md) where I treat it as like a diary updating every day/week with  more comprehensive explanations into what I am learning and the progress I'm making (something I cant really do that well on the weekly form).



#### Based on the science of "active recall", my project hopes to optimize ones abiity to learn by leveraging the [scientific research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5126970/?). It works by a user entering in their notes and testing questions for that day, and after one day, week, month and three months, those notes and questions will be shown to the user to the test them and put learned information into their long term memory. Being in 6th year, this would be extremely helpful to me and being aware of the scientific research I attempted to find a tool to help me leverage it. After futile effort I decided to build it as my TECS project.
