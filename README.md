 You can view my [Friction-log](/docs/friction-log.md) where I treat it as like a diary updating every day/week with  more comprehensive explanations into what I am learning and the progress I'm making (something I cant really do that well on the weekly form). 

#### My week one .md file can be viewed [here](docs/friction-log.md) where I provide a summary of my friction log for that week along with images etc
